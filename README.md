# Huffman_Compression

With the use of a Binary Tree and a Priority Queue, this programme takes in a given String and outputs its compressed Huffman Code.

Initially it will take in a String from the user and output each character in order of their frequency, if two characters have the same frequency their output will be in alphabetical order. It will also output the full binary code of the given String.

By using Binary Trees it will create a forest of trees for each letter and add them to the priority queue.

All trees will be merged together to form a Combo Tree. Its output will be its compressed Huffman Code including the rate of compression.
